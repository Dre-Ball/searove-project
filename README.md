***Mock company that offers cargo and/or passenger transportation from Earth to destination***

Based on OSU CS493 personal portfolio project found here: https://github.com/Dre-Ball/cs493_portfolio

Instead of using GCP Datastore as the database and GCP to host the API, this project will use MongoDB as the database and will be hosted on the cloud using Docker+AWS.

Future implementations:

ELK Stack
fully functioning front-end using React
offer different types of rockets/ships based on needs
space for cargo can be rented
client can opt to rent space for a group of passengers
